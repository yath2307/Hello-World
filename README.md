# Hello-World
My first repository...

Hello!

I am Yatharth Gupta , a complete noobie to the computer world.

I want to explore all these amazing things and that's why I am here.

In the last three months I have learned c programing , java(basics) , making apps , git and now git hub.

Although I have very less knowledge about the programing world but I am very curious and dedicated to learn all these stuffs.

I have a dream to become a great computer programmer and work for my dream company Google and I will do anything possible for that.

Besides all this I love to play cricket , badminton and listen music .

Thank You !
